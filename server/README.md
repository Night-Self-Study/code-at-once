# code-at-once Server

Server and Database using at code-at-once service

This project is based on **python** and **django** framework

If you want to run this server, use this command,

`  python manage.py runserver  `

And open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

If you didn't install django, follow :

`  sudo pip3 install django  `

I recommand you to use **python>=3.0** because django 1.11 is the last version supporting python 2.7.

And support for python 2.7 and django 1.11 will end in 2020.

If you want to make a new app, use this command,

`  python manage.py startapp "YOUR APP"  `
